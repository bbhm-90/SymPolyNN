# SymPolyNN
This repository contains the code used to generate the results presented in our paper, "Discovering Interpretable Elastoplasticity Models via the Neural Polynomial Method Enabled Symbolic Regressions," published in the Computer Methods in Applied Mechanics and Engineering Volume (CMAME) journal.


# Note
The code is provided as-is for academic use only. Please ensure you cite our paper if you use this code in your research.

## TODO

> A README guidance will be prepared soon.

> Some examples will be added/updated.

> Some coding parts in FEM and stress integration parts need to be modularized.
