# SymPolyNN
This repository contains the code used to generate the results presented in our paper, [Discovering Interpretable Elastoplasticity Models via the Neural Polynomial Method Enabled Symbolic Regressions](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0045782524000835) published in the Computer Methods in Applied Mechanics and Engineering (CMAME) journal.


# Note
The code is provided as-is for academic use only. Please ensure you cite our paper if you use this code in your research.

## TODO

> A README guidance will be prepared soon.

> Some examples will be added/updated.

> Some coding parts in FEM and stress integration parts need to be modularized.
